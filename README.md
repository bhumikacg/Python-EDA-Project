# ✨EDA – Hospitality Domain Data Analysis Project (AtliQ Grands)✨


I recently completed an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project in the hospitality domain using an imaginary hotel chain called AtliQ Grands. This project helped me understand how data analytics can solve real business challenges.


⭐️**Data Analysis Project Steps:** 


**1. Understanding the Business Problem**


AtliQ Grands, operating for 20 years in India, has been losing revenue due to lack of data-driven decision making and increasing competition.
This project focuses on identifying insights to support better decisions.


**2. Data Collection & Understanding**

The dataset contained 3 months of hotel booking data (May–July), with August data added later for deeper analysis. I worked with the following CSV files:


✅ Fact Tables:
-	fact_bookings
- fact_aggregated_bookings

  
✅ Dimension Tables:
-	dim_date
- dim_hotels
-	dim_rooms


**3. Data Cleaning & Exploration**

Performed ETL and exploratory steps using Python:

-	Handling null values
-	Outlier detection using standard deviation
-	Normalization
-	Data exploration using Pandas

**🔄 4. Data Transformation**

Applied a range of transformation techniques to prepare data for analysis:


-	Creating new calculated columns
-	Normalization
-	Merging multiple datasets
-	Aggregating booking and occupancy metrics

**🎯 5.Insights Generation** 

Using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed various ad-hoc analyses, including:


📌 Average occupancy rate by room category

📌 Average occupancy rate by city

📌 Revenue patterns, booking trends, and more



💡 This project strengthened my skills in:

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis

✔ Data Cleaning & Transformation

✔ Working with multi-table datasets

✔ Python libraries for analytics

✔ Understanding real-world business problems
